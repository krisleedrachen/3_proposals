      <h4 class="titles">What</h4>
      <p class="paragraph_deco">
        Our goal is to craft an experience for users as if they are hiring the
        digital undertaker
      </p>

      <h4 class="titles">Why</h4>
      <p class="paragraph_deco">
        Due to unremovable digital footprints such as revenge porn or
        distribution of illegal pornography, <br />clients can employ a digital
        undertaker to clean all traces of them on the internet.
      </p>

      <h4 class="titles">How</h4>
      <p class="paragraph_deco">
        We want to provoke and dramatize the emotions which come from the act of
        entirely erasing everything and letting go.

      <h4 class="titles">What</h4>
      <p class="paragraph_deco">
        Randonautica is an app which provides random coordinates to the user to
        explore local areas and report findings; however, users reportedly
        discovered dead bodies in a suitcase or received creepy anonymous texts.
        Some of them were real and police were involved, but some of them were
        concluded as fake for attention.
      </p>

      <h4 class="titles">Why</h4>
      <p class="paragraph_deco">
        The internet is a space which allows anything and everything to happen.
        To what extent can the public go for attention if guaranteed complete
        anonymity and freedom?

      <h2>Multi Identity</h2>
      <img src="img/identity.jpeg" width="500px" />
      <h3 class="titles">What</h3>
      <p class="paragraph_deco">
        We wanted to showcase to people the experience of having various
        identities on the internet.
      </p>

      <h3 class="titles">Why</h3>
      <p class="paragraph_deco">
        With the development of the internet, people are no longer confined to a
        single identity. In other words, on the internet, it has become
        impossible to know which persona is the user's true self. The internet
        allows users to indirectly experience the lives of users with diverse
        personalities and encourages them to explore their authentic selves.
      </p>
      <h3 class="titles">How</h3>
      <p class="paragraph_deco">
        Motivate users to explore and personally experience different accounts.
